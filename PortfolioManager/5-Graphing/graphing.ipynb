    "# Graphing & BQPlot\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, with a few tools at our disposal from our Python classes, let's introduce a visual component! We'll be using bqplot, a graphical library for creating interactive GUIs that Bloomberg created and published as open source. We'll cover the basics here, but you can find a more extensive tutorial at https://github.com/bqplot/bqplot! Using bqplot, we'd like to have the ability to plot the market value of our various entities over time. To handle this for now, we'll set up a simple loop which queries the market value (MV) of our entities. To start off, try plotting the market value of a single security in bqplot. The final goal of your plot should be the ability to graph the changes in your portfolio's market value over time. We can create a set of functions that generate data and interface with bqplot for reuse. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Plotter***\n",
    "- Create a method or class to plot the market value of a set of securities over time.\n",
    "    - Your class or method should take variables for the amount of data to be generated (i.e., give me a collection of security values of X size)\n",
    "    - Your graph output should have intractable data points. Clicking on a data point should print/log a string for that data point (i.e., Security X was valued at Y during Z)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Provided Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Data Source*\n",
    "\n",
    "For this portion, no additional data sources are given. You should modify your existing classes to allow for the desired functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Solution Interface*\n",
    "\n",
    "For this portion no additional interfaces are given. Your plotter solution should create a graph of a given security's market value over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Testing*\n",
    "\n",
    "For testing, you can update your position, account, and portfolio modules from the previous sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stretch Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've completed graphing your portfolio's market value over time, you can attempt to create a set of plotting solutions that allow for the graphs of positions, accounts, and portfolios over time. Some of the suggested stretch goals are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a method or class to plot the market value of a set of positions over time. Your solution show allow for drilling down into a particular position & seeing the position's security value over time.\n",
    "- Create a method or class to plot the market value of a set of accounts/portfolio over time. Your solution show allow for drilling down into a particular account and seeing the account's position MVs over time."
