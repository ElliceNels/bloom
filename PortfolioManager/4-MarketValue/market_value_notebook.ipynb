    "# Market Value Item\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is market value?\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the previously discussed items have focused on different collections of securities (positions, accounts, and portfolios). Now we're going to take another step forward and discuss market value. Market value is generally the price that an asset of any type (e.g., equity, fixed income, derivatives, fx) would fetch in the marketplace. It is also the total value of the securities in which you hold a position. Depending on the security type, market value can be simple (i.e., for equities, the value of a unit is well-known) or more complex with various options (i.e., for derivatives, there are a few ways to determine and/or state what the market value of your position is).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purpose we'll stick with simple market value calculations where market value is equal to some unit multiplier times your positions\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could have a position and current share price/unit market value like below:\n",
    "\n",
    "My position is ***2000*** shares of ***MSFT USD***. The current price of ***MSFT USD*** is ***19.00***. This gives my position a \n",
    "market value of **38,000 USD**!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to extend our classes to allow for querying of the market values for various securities at different levels of aggregation. We want this classes to have to the ability below functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Security***\n",
    "- Query the current market value of the security\n",
    "\n",
    "***Positions*** \n",
    "- Query the current market value for the current position\n",
    "\n",
    "***Account***\n",
    "- Query the market value for a given set of security names or security objects. These objects should act as filters to what should be included in calculating the accounts net market value. Any securities not present in the account but the filter can be ignored\n",
    "- Query the market value for the entire account. This should return a net market value of all positions in the account.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Portfolio***\n",
    "- Query the market value for the entire portfolio. This requires that security market values be atomic in your calculation method per query.\n",
    "- Query the market value for a given set of securities/account combinations. If securities are present they should act as a filter on the accounts to be queried. If accounts are present they should act as a filter on the accounts under query. Handle scenarios where securities or accounts given aren't present without causing exceptions.\n",
    "- **Create tests for the above portfolio features**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Provided Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Data Source*\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate prices, you can utilize the given class priceData which can be imported from generators.priceDataGenerator. This class is a singleton and will generate prices each time a query is given. These prices are stored internally in the class for testing in a replay mode. For a given security if the security name contains \"Equity\" or \"eqty\" (case insensitive) the market value will always be positive. To query the price of a security you can use the object's getCurrentPrice method. Below is an example of this\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#Data Souce\n",
    "from generators.priceDataGenerator import priceData\n",
    "\n",
    "pD = priceData()\n",
    "\n",
    "curPrice = pD.getCurrentPrice(\"IBM US Equity\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Solution Interface*\n",
    "\n",
    "The below interface show the new functionality you should add to your existing classes.\n",
